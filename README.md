## Resources
 * [Web Color Chart](http://html-color-codes.com/) I used this site to come up with the hex values for my background colors.
 * [background - CSS | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) I used this as a reference to make sure I was writing out the background css code correctly.
 * [Using Media Queries - CSS | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) This site was up the entire time I worked on this project. Along with my lecture notes, I used this as a guide as I wrote my media queries to double check myself. This was a thorough guide with great examples.

## Comments
 * I feel very comfortable with media queries, especially after this assignment. I have seen how essential they are for responsive web design. At my work, we have a bad habit of working from desktop to mobile. I want to try to challenge my team from now on to start small and work up, using more min-widths instead of max-widths so we aren't having to override ourselves as much. That's the main lesson I've taken from this assignment.
